                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The National Association of Badagry West Students' (NABWES) was established in 2006/2007 by a group of students hailing from the Badagry West region, who were pursuing higher education in various tertiary institutions across the nation. They recognized the need for a home-based student union to create a bridge between home and their academic pursuits, particularly to reach out to the younger generation at the grassroots level.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">NABWES was founded with the primary purpose of fostering a sense of community among students from Badagry West, providing a platform for them to connect, and strengthening the bonds that tie them to their home region. Additionally, the association was formed to cater to the welfare of its members and to act as an advocate for their rights within the educational system.                            
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Over the span of <span id="start-year"> </span> years, NABWES has witnessed the transition of seven different administrations within both the students' executive council and the students' parliamentary council. Through these changes in leadership, NABWES has continued to fulfill its mission of supporting Badagry West students and ensuring that their voices are heard, leaving a significant impact on the education and well-being of its members.
